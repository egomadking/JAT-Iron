# JAT-Iron, Job Application Tracker

🚧 🏗️ 👷 *This app is currently under development. More information will be provided as it exists* 👷 🏗️ 🚧

For a prospective software engineer, one of the most daunting challenges is getting that first job. One has to cast nets one's wide but cannot just use a shotgun approach. There's enough articles floating around about new grads applying to "100's" of companies that illustrate the futility of this approach. I'm not about this shenanigans.

One has to stay on top of details that go along with each application: company name, points of contact, position description(must-haves, likes, compensation, etc), buzzword-soup, posting/closing dates. Not only that, one has to track the state of each application- when a resume was submitted, any interactions with POC's, upcoming screenings/interviews, and notes on evaluated homework.

Tailored resumes and cover letters are an important part of the process. But, because they are stand-alone documents made in word processors and emailed about, they will reside outside of this system. They would be managed better outside of a browser interface. This app will focus on the relationship management aspects of job applications.

## This app will let users

- Create a new job-search (find a better name for model)
- Add new jobs to the job-search using a fillable form (no imports at this time)
- View a summary of all jobs in job search
- View a summary of all jobs based on status
- View details of a single job
- Update status on each job: new(default), applied, interviewing, offer, accepted, rejected, decline, closed.
- Edit each job
- Add notes to each job
