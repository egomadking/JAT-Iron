## About

For a prospective software engineer, one of the most daunting challenges is getting that first job. One has to cast nets one's wide but cannot just use a shotgun approach. There's enough articles floating around about new grads applying to "100's" of companies that illustrate the futility of this approach. I'm not about this shenanigans.

One has to stay on top of details that go along with each application: company name, points of contact, position description(must-haves, likes, compensation, etc), buzzword-soup, posting/closing dates. Not only that, one has to track the state of each application- when a resume was submitted, any interactions with POC's, upcoming screenings/interviews, and notes on evaluated homework.

Tailored resumes and cover letters are an important part of the process. But, because they are stand-alone documents made in word processors and emailed about, they will reside outside of this system. They would be managed better outside of a browser interface. This app will focus on the relationship management aspects of job applications.

This application runs on a Ruby on Rails back-end on a local server. The entry point for the app is frontend/index.html. A server has to be running from the jat-iron-api directory. *Installation and operating instructions can be found in the README.md files found under frontend/ and jat-iron-api/ directories.*

## Features

This app will allow users to:

- Create a new job search
- Add new jobs to the job-search (no imports at this time)
- View a summary of all jobs
- View a summary of all jobs based on status
- View details of a single job
- Edit job

## Contribution

Bottom line: I will be a kind human. Please be the same in return.

Please submit a contribution idea through an issue ticket before working on a pull request. Don't submit a pull request unless it has been discussed through an issue ticket. I happily respond to all contructive inquiries.

As this project evolves, I will update this readme and how contributions are accepted.
